    <div id="aboutMeText">
    <p>Hello! I'm Gavin Acosta, a 21-year-old from Lockport, Louisiana, with a passion for software development. I recently graduated from Nicholls State University where I studied Mathematics with a concentration in Computer Science and a minor in Business, completing my degree a year and half early. </p>
    <p>Throughout my academic career, I developed strong skills in JavaScript, C#, and SQL. These skills combined with my dedication and enthusiasm for coding have prepared me well for a career in the tech industry. I spend much of my free time working on various coding projects, continuously learning and honing my craft.</p>
    <p>During my time at Nicholls State University, I was actively involved in campus life. I served on the orientation team, helping new students acclimate to university life, and I held the position of Vice President of the TKE Mu Zeta fraternity where I developed my leadership and organizational skills.</p>
    <p>In addition to coding, I enjoy playing poker, which has taught me valuable lessons in strategy, patience, and decision-making under pressure.</p>
    <p>I'm currently seeking a job in software development where I can leverage my skills and experiences to make a positive impact on the tech industry. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with talented professionals to drive technological advancements.</p>
